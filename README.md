# DISCRIPTION ABOUT MULTITHREADED-CHAT-APPLICATION
A Multithreaded Chat Application is a network-based program that enables multiple users to communicate with each other in real-time. It leverages the concept of multithreading to handle multiple clients simultaneously, ensuring smooth and efficient communication.
Key Features:
Multithreading:
Each client is managed by a separate thread on the server, allowing concurrent communication without blocking other clients.
Improves scalability and performance for multiple users.

Client-Server Model:
A central server mediates communication between all connected clients.
Clients send messages to the server, which then broadcasts them to other clients.

Real-Time Messaging:
Messages are transmitted and received instantly, giving users the experience of a live chat.

Private and Group Messaging:
Supports group chats (broadcast messages to all clients) and private chats (messages directed to specific users).

Synchronization:
Ensures thread-safe communication by using synchronization techniques (like locks) to prevent data races and maintain consistency.

Components:
Server:
Manages client connections.
Creates a new thread for each connected client.
Handles message broadcasting.

Client:
Interface for users to send and receive messages.
Communicates with the server for message transmission.

Protocol:
Defines how messages are formatted, sent, and interpreted (e.g., JSON, XML, or plain text).
